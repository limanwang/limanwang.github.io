I am a PhD student at the [University of York, UK](https://www.york.ac.uk/#/). I major in Multimodal Large Language Models in Robotics.
I graduated with a Master's degree in Intelligent Robotics (first-class honor, with the first place in the class) from the University of York.
I worked as an NLP algorithm engineer at [Schneider Electric Co., Ltd.](https://www.se.com/ww/en/#/), a Fortune Global 500 company, for 3 years.  
I love surfskatingðŸ›¹!
If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate.
