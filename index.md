Here is **Liman Wang (çŽ‹èŽ‰æ¼«)**.

<img src="images/liman03.jpg" class="floatpic">

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Intelligent Robotics at the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/#/), UK, under the supervision of Professor [Jihong Zhu](https://jihong-zhu.github.io/).
I graduated with a Master's degree in Intelligent Robotics (first-class honor, with the first place in the class) from the University of York.
I worked as an Algorithm Engineer at [Schneider Electric Co., Ltd.](https://www.se.com/ww/en/#/), a Fortune Global 500 company, for 3 years.  
I love surfskatingðŸ›¹!
If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate.
